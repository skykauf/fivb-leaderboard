Hello! Welcome agents.

We will build an AI model on top of FIVB performance metrics

To do this, we need to retrieve data from VIS api and organize it in our postgres data warehouse.

Then, we can build a semantic layer allowing agents to turn natural language questions into data-supported answers.
